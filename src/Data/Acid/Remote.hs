 Module      :  Data.Acid.Remote
 Copyright   :  PublicDomain

 Maintainer  :  lemmih@gmail.com
 Portability :  non-portable (uses GHC extensions)

 This module provides the ability perform 'update' and 'query' calls
from a remote process.

On the server-side you:

 1. open your 'AcidState' normally

 2. then use 'acidServer' to share the state

On the client-side you:

 1. use 'openRemoteState' to connect to the remote state

 2. use the returned 'AcidState' like any other 'AcidState' handle

'openRemoteState' and 'acidServer' communicate over an unencrypted
socket. If you need an encrypted connection, see @acid-state-tls@.

On Unix®-like systems you can use 'UnixSocket' to create a socket file for
local communication between the client and server. Access can be
controlled by setting the permissions of the parent directory
containing the socket file.

It is also possible to perform some simple authentication using
'sharedSecretCheck' and 'sharedSecretPerform'. Keep in mind that
secrets will be sent in plain-text if you do not use
@acid-state-tls@. If you are using a 'UnixSocket' additional
authentication may not be required, so you can use
'skipAuthenticationCheck' and 'skipAuthenticationPerform'.

Working with a remote 'AcidState' is nearly identical to working with
a local 'AcidState' with a few important differences.

The connection to the remote 'AcidState' can be lost. The client will
automatically attempt to reconnect every second. Because 'query'
events do not affect the state, an aborted 'query' will be retried
automatically after the server is reconnected.

If the connection was lost during an 'update' event, the event will
not be retried. Instead 'RemoteConnectionError' will be raised. This
is because it is impossible for the client to know if the aborted
update completed on the server-side or not.

When using a local 'AcidState', an update event in one thread does not
block query events taking place in other threads. With a remote
connection, all queries and requests are channeled over a single
connection. As a result, updates and queries are performed in the
order they are executed and do block each other. In the rare case
where this is an issue, you could create one remote connection per
thread.

When working with local state, a query or update which returns the
whole state is not usually a problem due to memory sharing. The
update/query event basically just needs to return a pointer to the
data already in memory. But, when working remotely, the entire result
will be serialized and sent to the remote client. Hence, it is good
practice to create queries and updates that will only return the
required data.

This module is designed to be extenible. You can easily add your own
authentication methods by creating a suitable pair of functions and
passing them to 'acidServer' and 'openRemoteState'.

It is also possible to create alternative communication layers using
'CommChannel', 'process', and 'processRemoteState'.

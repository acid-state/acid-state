-- | @'repairFile' path@ will truncate the entries in @file@ until there are
-- only valid entries (if a corrupted entry is found, then the rest of the file
-- is truncated).
--
-- The old file will be copied to @path.bak@ (or @path.bak.1@, etc… if the file
-- already exists).
--
-- 'repairFile' tries very hard to avoid leaving files in an inconsistent state:
-- the truncated file is written in a temporary file, which is then moved into
-- place, similarly copies are performed with moves instead. Still this is not
-- fully atomic: there are two consecutive moves, so 'repairFile' may, in case
-- of crash, yield a state where the @path.bak@ file is there but no @path@ is
-- there anymore, this would require manual intervention.

-- | Repairs the WAL files with the following strategy:
--
-- * Let `f` be the oldest corrupted file.
-- * All files older than `f` is left untouched
-- * `f` is repaired with `repairFile`
-- * Old files younger than `f` is dropped (and saved to `path.bak`, or
--   `path.bak.1`, etc…)
--
-- In other words, all the log entries after the first corrupted entry is
-- dropped. The reasoning is that newer entries are likely not to make sense
-- after some entries have been removed from the log. This strategy guarantees a
-- consistent state, albeit a potentially old one.

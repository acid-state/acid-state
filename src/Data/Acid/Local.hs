{-| State container offering full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)
    guarantees.

    [@Atomicity@]  State changes are all-or-nothing. This is what you'd expect of any state
                   variable in Haskell and AcidState doesn't change that.

    [@Consistency@] No event or set of events will break your data invariants.

    [@Isolation@] Transactions cannot interfere with each other even when issued in parallel.

    [@Durability@] Successful transaction are guaranteed to survive system failure (both
                   hardware and software).

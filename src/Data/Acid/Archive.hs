-- Any @'Archiver'{'archiveWrite', 'archiveRead'}@ must satisfy the
-- round-trip property:
--
-- > forall xs . entriesToList (archiveRead (archiveWrite xs)) == xs
--
-- Moreover, 'archiveWrite' must be a monoid homomorphism, so that
-- concatenating archives is equivalent to concatenating the lists of
-- entries that they represent:
--
-- > archiveWrite [] == empty
-- > forall xs ys . archiveWrite xs <> archiveWrite ys == archiveWrite (xs ++ ys)
